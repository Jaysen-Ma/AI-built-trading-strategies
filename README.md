Strategies built by Agent Zero with Quant Enhancements

This strategy has not been optimised, it has been generated by the Quant AI at https://github.com/Jaysen-Ma/agent-zero-quant.

At the moment, it uses an unoptimised catboost model to predict the movements the next m mins, and place trades accordingly every n mins.

More cross-validation and back testing strategies can further improve this.

Data cleaning and feature engineering can also be optmised.

This is a preview that the AI can use terminal output to debug and optimise its code when prompted to build a trading strategy.
